# Basler Camera Codes
In this branch I will share my codes(with description on itsels) of the Basler Camera using pypylon, The official python the wrapper for the Basler pylon Camera Software Suite.

Background information about usage of pypylon, programming samples and jupyter notebooks can also be found at https://github.com/basler/pypylon-samples.

I used this codes on my internship _**"Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Thin Layers of Laser Dyes for Biological Applications"**_ which in it I constructed a high-res spectrometer, aligned it and wrote Python codes for high-resolution separation for the acA4024-29um basler camera.
In it I'm studying the conversion of photon energy using fluorescence spectroscopy with spatial resolution on Rh6g and RhB100 dyes for the purpose of labeling biological structures and fluorescence imaging of them.

 # _These codes will be updated every week._
